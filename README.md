DS Sales is a Full Stack Java web application built during the 3Âª edition of the **DevSuperior Week** (#sds3), an event organized by [DevSuperior](https://devsuperior.com.br/cursos "DevSuperior Website").

The application aims to show a Dashboard that contains graphs of the sales success rate of each of the sellers and a list of sellers that describes the date, the number of customers visited, the business done and the total sales value of each one of the sellers.
